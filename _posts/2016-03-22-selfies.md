> Hi. Do you have a selfie?
> I'm not talking about a picture of yourself, that you took yourself, by yourself, though that is technically the textbook definition of the word. I'm asking about your "selfie": a virtual doppelg√§nger that looks like you, has been everywhere you have been, has smiled every time you smiled, and was created by you, but then flies off to have adventures without you. The selfie is an imprint of yourself, tossed into a virtual ocean, flying forward into the future to meet the stares of people you will never know.
